ChessBoard: 
    changed selfInCheck() to isInCheck()

Player: 
    added accessor for isCheckmate(), isStalemate(), getColor()
    !!! player now has access to the chessboard via pointer
    added accessor for board ^^^

AI:
    made generateMove() private
        since we now have pointer to chessboard, removed parameter board

Game: 
    make p1,p2 -> pw pb
    prinstScoreBoard now private method
    made a reset private method to clean up after game finishes
